# How to Host Journal Club

This is the Minin Group Guide to hosting journal club, inspired by the many great [Leek Group Guides](https://github.com/seankross/guides).

## What is journal club?

Journal club is a (usually) weekly meeting where someone in the group presents on a paper they're interested in. Unlike seminars, in journal club, everyone is expected to have read the paper before the meeting. On some occasions, journal club time is used for presenting research updates, practice talks, or eating corn in a cup.

## How to be a presenter

-   Before the presentation

    -   Skim the paper before recommending it.

    -   **Tell everyone in advance** in the `#group_meetings` channel on Slack. The earlier the better.

    -   Give some context for why you want the group to read the paper. Ex:

        -   "This is a foundational paper in a topic I'm starting to get interested in."

        -   "This is a brand new paper and it seems exciting, but I'm a little skeptical."

    -   Send a reminder message on slack the day before.

-   The presentation:

    -   The presentation doesn't have to be fancy, screenshots and quotes are okay.

    -   Provide context if the paper is on a topic that not everyone is familiar with.

    -   Prepare some concluding thoughts on both **substance (the science) and style (the presentation)**:

        -   Pretend like you are doing a mini [paper review](https://github.com/jtleek/reviews).

        -   Some sentence starters:

            -   "I liked..."

            -   "I didn't like..."

            -   "I wasn't sure about..."

    -   Prepare some discussion questions.

        -   How does this relate to other papers we've read?

        -   What did you like/not like?

        -   What didn't you understand?

## How to be an audience member

-   [Read the paper.](https://github.com/jtleek/readingpapers)

-   Exhibit supportive body language

    -   Nod along to show you are following the presentation.

    -   Make eye contact with the speaker so they know you are paying attention to them.

    -   Smile so the speaker can relax.

-   Prepare a few comments / questions.
